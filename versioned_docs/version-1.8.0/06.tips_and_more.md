## Keyword Arguments

LedgerSync heavily uses ruby keyword arguments so as to make it clear what values are being passed and which attributes
are required. When this README says something like “the `fun_function` function takes the argument foo” that translates
to
`fun_function(foo: :some_value)`.

## Fingerprints

Most objects in LedgerSync can be fingerprinted by calling the instance method `fingerprint`. For example:

```ruby
puts LedgerSync::Customer.new.fingerprint # "b3eab7ec00431a4ae0468fee72e5ba8f"

puts LedgerSync::Customer.new.fingerprint == LedgerSync::Customer.new.fingerprint # true
puts LedgerSync::Customer.new.fingerprint == LedgerSync::Customer.new(name: :foo).fingerprint # false
puts LedgerSync::Customer.new.fingerprint == LedgerSync::Payment.new.fingerprint # false
```

Fingerprints are used to compare objects. This method is used in de-duping objects, as it only considers the data inside
and not the instance itself (as shown above).

## Serialization

Most objects in LedgerSync can be serialized by calling the instance method `serialize`. For example:

```ruby
puts LedgerSync::Payment.new(
  customer: LedgerSync::Customer.new
)

{
  root: "LedgerSync::Payment/8eed81c0177801a001f2544f0c85e21d",
  objects: {
    "LedgerSync::Payment/8eed81c0177801a001f2544f0c85e21d": {
      id: "LedgerSync::Payment/8eed81c0177801a001f2544f0c85e21d",
      object: "LedgerSync::Payment",
      fingeprint: "8eed81c0177801a001f2544f0c85e21d",
      data: {
        currency: nil,
        amount: nil,
        customer: {
          object: "reference",
          id: "LedgerSync::Customer/b3eab7ec00431a4ae0468fee72e5ba8f"
        },
        external_id: "",
        ledger_id: nil,

      }
    },
    "LedgerSync::Customer/b3eab7ec00431a4ae0468fee72e5ba8f": {
      id: "LedgerSync::Customer/b3eab7ec00431a4ae0468fee72e5ba8f",
      object: "LedgerSync::Customer",
      fingeprint: "b3eab7ec00431a4ae0468fee72e5ba8f",
      data: {
        name: nil,
        email: nil,
        phone_number: nil,
        external_id: "",
        ledger_id: nil
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The serialization of any object follows the same structure. There is a `:root` key that holds the ID of the root object.
There is also an `:objects` hash that contains all of the objects for this serialization. As you can see, unique nested
objects listed in the `:objects` hash and referenced using a “reference object”, in this case:

```ruby
{
  object: "reference",
  id: "LedgerSync::Customer/b3eab7ec00431a4ae0468fee72e5ba8f"
}
```
