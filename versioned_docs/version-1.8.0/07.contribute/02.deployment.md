title: Deployment

:::note
Only contributors can deploy new versions of the gem to RubyGems.org.
:::

To deploy a new version of the gem to RubyGems, you can use the `release.sh` script in the root. The script takes
advantage of the [bump gem](https://github.com/gregorym/bump). So you may call the script using any of the following:

```ruby
# Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
./release.sh patch # to bump X in 1.1.X
./release.sh minor # to bump X in 1.X.1
./release.sh major # to bump X in X.1.1
```
